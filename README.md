# Multi-objective Optimization for Safety in AC Substation Grounding

This project implements a multi-objective optimization framework for the optimal design of grounding systems in AC substations, following the analytical methodology of IEEE Std. 80.

## 🔧 Structure and Instructions

- **Main script:**  
  The main executable MATLAB file is `SPT.m`. This is the master script from which the optimization process is initiated.

- **Constraints:**  
  All design and safety constraints are defined in the file `Const.m`.

- **Objective Functions:**  
  The file `multiobj.m` contains the objective functions used in the optimization model.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- The code is currently configured to run with **two objective functions**.
- Users may modify the content of `multiobj.m` to define alternative or additional objective functions based on specific design requirements.
